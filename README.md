# CP R Bootcamp

This repository aims to help get users up to speed with learning the basics of R. We use the package learnr to set up the practice environment. Please visit the [CP R Bootcamp]('https://broad.io/cp_r_bootcamp') site to have an interactive version of that site that needs minimal setup.
