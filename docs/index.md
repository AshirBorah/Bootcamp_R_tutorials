A common plage to collect all relevant information for the R Bootcamp. This will also be the place for any corrections, announcements and a place to get all relevant links for class. Feel free to drop me (Ashir Borah, ashir dot borah at ucsf.edu) an email if you have any questions. Slack is often easier and faster

Before the first class, please **ensure that you complete [lesson 0](https://ashir.shinyapps.io/lesson_0_pres/)** which will help you set up a working R, RStudio and the required packages for this course.
